# Spreadsheet Formatting Script

A short script to format a spreadsheet. 

Fall semester of my Sophomore year of college I was looking for a summer internship. I sent out a bunch of applications and I was keeping track of them in a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet grew pretty quickly and manually formatting it was getting to be way too cumbersome. So I did some research and found Google Apps Scripts. At this point in my career I only knew some Java and basically nothing else.

So I learned some vanilla Javascript and over a few days over winter break I developed this script to format my spreadsheet for me.

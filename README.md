# Spreadsheet Formatting Script

A short script to automate formatting a spreadsheet.

## The Backstory

Fall semester of my Sophomore year of college I was looking for a summer internship. I sent out a bunch of applications and I was keeping track of them in a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet grew pretty quickly and manually formatting it was getting to be way too cumbersome. So I did some research and found Google Apps Scripts. At this point in my career I only knew some Java and basically nothing else.

So I learned some vanilla Javascript and over a few days over winter break I developed this script to format my spreadsheet for me.

## To demo
For now, if you want to see the script in action, clone this repo and view ScriptInAction.mp4

School and work take up most of my time at the moment, so this less than ideal solution for a demo will have to do.
